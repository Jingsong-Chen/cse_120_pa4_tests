# cse_120_pa4_tests

**The author of the test cases is Tianheng Liu.

I disabled the header printing for each test case
and automated the testing process.

If you haven't done so, it's a good time to

BACKUP YOU CODE!

Copy everything in the folder to pa4 directory.

In your pa4 directory run "./runAndCompare.sh"

The bash script will automatically make the tests,
run all of them with your code and the provided
working funcitons, compare the results, and display
the differences. If everything's doing well, the
only difference displayed for each test case should
be the time stamps.
