# cse_120_pa4_tests

If you haven't done so, it's a good time to

BACKUP YOU CODE!

Copy the Makefile and the entire Tests directory into pa4 directory.

run "make test".

t1-6 r1-6 tpa4c rpa4c should be generated.

t* uses the thread package we implemented (functions start with "My").

r* uses the thread package of UMIX (functions without "My").

Output of r* should be the expected output.
